Hello Alice! My name is UNIVAC!

Are you having fun programming today?

You can ask me about the first computer bug, or

which countries use the imperial measurement system.

I can even convert miles to kilometers!



Tell me Bot, which countries use the imperial system?

There are 3 countries that use the imperial measurement system.

They are the United States of America, Liberia, and Myanmar



Tell me Bot, what was the first computer bug?

It's said that the first computer bug was found 

on September 9, 1945 by Harvard technicians who 

found a moth in their computer!



It's always nice to chat!

Have a great day!
